title: Arbitrum VM informal architecture spec
sidebar_label: Arbitrum VM Specification
---

This document describes informally the semantics of the Arbitrum VM architecture. This version is simplified, compared to the one described in the Arbitrum paper published in USENIX Security 2018. This version is also tailored to more closely match the Ethereum data formats and instruction set, to ease implementation of an EVM-to-AVM translator.

We expect that some implementations will optimize to save time and space, provided that the result is equivalent to what is described here.

## Values

A Value can have the following types:

-   Integer: a 256-bit integer;
-   Codepoint: a Value that represents a point in the executable code (implemented as a triple (pc, operation, nextcodehash);
-   Tuple: an array of up to 8 slots, numbered consecutively from zero, with each slot containing a Value.

Note that integer values are not explicitly specified as signed or unsigned. Where the distinction matters, this specification states which operations treat values as signed and which treat them as unsigned. (Where there is no difference, this spec does not specify signed vs. unsigned.)

The special value None refers to a 0-tuple (a tuple containing 0 elements).

Note that the slots of a Tuple may in turn contain other Tuples. As a result, a Tuple may represent an arbitrary multi-level tree (more precisely, a distributed acyclic graph) of values.

Note that all Values are immutable. As a consequence of this, it is impossible to make a Tuple that contains itself either directly or indirectly (reason: if Tuple A contains Tuple B, then A must have been created after B).

Because Tuples are immutable and form an acyclic structure, it is possible for an implementation to represent a Tuple as a pointer to a small array object, and to use reference counting to manage the lifetime of Tuples.

## Operations

There are two types of operations:

-   BasicOp: A simple opcode
-   ImmediateOp: A opcode along with a Value

Execution of an operation behaves as follows:

-   BasicOp: Execute the opcode according to the instruction definition included below
-   ImmediateOp: First push the included Value to the stack. Then execute the opcode as described below

## Stacks

A stack represents a (possibly empty) pushdown stack of Values. Stacks support Push and Pop operations, which have the expected semantics. Doing a Pop operation on a stack that is empty causes the VM to enter the Error state. A stack is represented as either None (for an empty stack) or the 2-tuple [topValue, restOfStack], where restOfStack in turn is a stack.

## Marshaling

Marshaling is an invertible mapping from a Value to an array of bytes. Outside the VM, Values are typically represented in Marshaled form.

Unmarshaling is the inverse operation, which turns an array of bytes into a Value. This document does not specify the Unmarshaling operation, except to say that for all Values V, Unmarshal(Marshal(V)) yields V. If a byte-array A could not possibly have been made by marshaling, then attempting to compute unmarshal(A) raises an Error.

An Integer marshals to

-   the byte 0
-   32-byte big-endian representation of the value.

A Codepoint marshals to:

-   byte val of 1
-   8-byte big-endian representation of the pc.
-   the marshalling of the operation
-   32-byte nextHash value

A BasicOp marshals to:

-   byte val of 0
-   1-byte representation of the opcode

A ImmediateOp marshals to:

-   byte val of 1
-   1-byte representation of the opcode
-   Marshalled value

A Tuple marshals to

-   byte val of (3 + the number of items in the tuple)
-   the concatenation of the results of marshaling the Value in each slot of the Tuple.

## Hashing Values

The Hash of an Integer is the Keccak-256 of the 8-byte big endian encoding of the integer, encoded as an Integer in big-endian fashion.

For other Values, the Hash of a value is computed by Marshaling the Value into a sequence of bytes, then computing the Keccak-256 hash of that byte sequence, encoded as an Integer in big-endian fashion.

## Virtual Machine State

The state of a VM is either a special state Halted, or a special state ErrorStop, or an extensive state.

An extensive state of a VM contains the following:

-   Current Codepoint: a Codepoint that represents the current point of execution;
-   Data Stack: a Stack that is the primary working area for computation;
-   Aux Stack: a Stack that provides auxiliary storage;
-   Register: a mutable storage cell that can hold a single Value;
-   Static: an immutable Value that is initialized when the VM is created;
-   Error Codepoint: a Codepoint that is meant to be used in response to an Error.

When a VM is initialized, it is in an extensive state. The Data Stack, Aux Stack, Register, and Error Codepoint are initialized to None, None, None, and the Codepoint (0, 0, 0), respectively. The entity that creates the VM supplies the initial values of the Current Codepoint and Static.

## Hashing a VM State

If a VM is in the Halted state, its state hash is the Integer 0.

If a VM is in the ErrorStop state, its state hash is the Integer 1.

If a VM is in an extensive state, its state hash is computed by concatenating the hash of the Instruction Stack, the hash of the Data Stack, the hash of the Aux Stack, the hash of the Register, the hash of the Static, and the hash of the Error Codepoint, hashing the result using Keccak-256.

## The Runtime Environment

The Runtime Environment is a VM’s interface to the outside world. Certain instructions are described as interacting with the Runtime Environment.

The implementation of the Runtime Environment will vary in different scenarios. In standalone AVM emulators, the Runtime Environment might be controlled by command-line options or a configuration file. In production uses of Arbitrum, the Runtime Environment will be provided by an Arbitrum Validator, and will be specified by Preconditions that form part of Assertions in the Arbitrum Protocol.

The runtime environment will supply values for:

-   lower and upper bounds on the time (Integers)
-   a Value that is the contents of VM’s Inbox
-   a reference to a “Wallet” object

Implementers and developers can assume that the Runtime Environment will satisfy the following properties:

-   Time consistency: if an execution of the gettime instruction returns a lower bound of L, then no later execution of the gettime instruction will return an upper bound less than L.
-   Balance consistency (enforced by the Wallet): If either the send or nbsend instruction allows a message to be sent, the amount of a currency transmitted by the message is less than the difference between the total amount of that currency carried by incoming messages in the inbox, and the total amount of that currency previously sent in outgoing messages.
-   Inbox consistency: If the Inbox instruction returns V at one point in time, and returns a different value W at a later point in time, then (a) V appears as a subtree in the tuple-tree W, and (b) the sequence of messages represented by V is a prefix of the sequence of messages represented by W.

## Inbox and Messages

Each VM has an Inbox, which is supplied by the Runtime Environment. At any time the inbox holds a single value representing a sequence of messages. An Inbox contains either:

-   None, indicating that the Inbox contains no messages;
-   a 3-tuple [0, b, v], where b is an Inbox and v is a value, indicating that the inbox contains the sequence of messages in b followed by the message v; or
-   a 3-tuple [1, b, c], where b and c are Inboxes, indicating that the Inbox contains the sequence of messages in b followed by the sequence of messages in c.

Each Message is a 4-tuple [value, sender, amount, currency], where value is a Value, sender is the Arbitrum identity of the party who sent the Message, amount denotes the amount of that currency transferred by the sender to the VM in the Message represented as an Integer, and currency is a non-negative Integer identifying a particular currency. (The Arbitrum protocol ensures that the sender is verified and the currency really was transferred, so you can rely on the sender identity being accurate, and on the incoming transfer of currency having occurred.)

A VM can receive from its Inbox by using the inbox instruction (described below), which pushes the current Inbox contents onto the Data Stack.

Note that different values of the Inbox can denote the same sequence of messages.

Note that a VM’s Inbox will contain the full sequence of messages received by the Inbox over all time, since the VM’s creation. Messages are never removed from the Inbox. The Inbox structure is designed in a way that allows a VM to determine efficiently which messages have arrived since a previous point in time. This allows an AVM program to process each incoming message once.

## Errors

Certain conditions are said to “raise an Error”. If an Error is raised when the Error Codepoint is (0,0,0), then the VM enters the ErrorStop state. If an Error is raised when the Error Codepoint is not (0,0,0), then the Current Codepoint is set equal to the Error Codepoint.

## Blocking

Some instructions are said to “block” until some condition is true. This means that if the condition is false, the instruction cannot complete execution and the VM must stay in the state it was in before the instruction. If the condition is true, the VM can execute the instruction. The result is as if the VM stopped and waited until the condition became true.

## Instructions

A VM that is in the Halted or ErrorStop state cannot execute instructions.

A VM that is in an extensive state can execute an instruction. To execute an instruction, the VM gets the opcode from the Current Codepoint.

If the opcode is not a value that is an opcode of the AVM instruction set, then an Error is raised. Otherwise the VM carries out the semantics of the opcode.

The instructions are as follows:

| Opcode                                          | Nickname      | Semantics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
